Description: This package provides a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based approach for background correction of multiplex tissue imaging intensities. BgNorm adjusts technical background signal at the pixel or cell level, generating background-adjusted measurements suitable for downstream spatial and single-cell analyses.
